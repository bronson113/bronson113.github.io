Project
: ### [Cute Floating Ghost](https://www.shadertoy.com/view/cdSBWV)
: *July 2023* \| Shader, GLSL, Ray marching
: This animation is cretaed using ray marching and sharder math. I draw the ghost that float and move in the ocean!
: There will be a blog post about this! Stay tune!
: ### [Ascii art web server](https://github.com/bronson113/ascii_art_web_server)
: *April 2023 - May 2023* \| Server, Cocurrency, OS 
: This project created a server with web interface that takes a url to an image and converts it to ascii art. The server spawns works threads and spread the incoming connections to the different workers to allow cocurrent processing. The server experiments with the new proc_fd and the ability to pass file descriptors to different processes. 
: ### [Padding Oracle On Custom Padding Methods](/2023/09/08/hitconctf-2023-careless-padding.html)
: *March 2023 - April 2023*  \| Cryptography, Block Cipher
: Discoverd efficient attack method against novel padding method proposed in [this conference paper](https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-319-30840-1_21)
: Created a CTF challenge based on the attack method in HITCON CTF
: ### [Vulnerability Explorer](https://github.com/bronson113/vuln_visualizer)
: *January 2023 - current*   \|  Python, Flask, Compiler \| !Note that this project is still in idea phase 
: Visualized execution of vulnerable program graphically for better comprehension
: Implemented simplified compiler for easy experimentation
: ### [mktmpdir](https://github.com/bronson113/mktmpdir)
: *January 2023* \| Shellscript, Bash
: This is a simple shellscript that drops the user into a temprary folder. This script allows user to do simple expirements without worrying about messing up the folder structure. The script supports keeping the result of the temprary folder and naming the session
: ### Raspnerry PI Remote Display Server
: *December 2021* \| Python, Flask, LCD display
: Designed Interaction between web server and hardware LCD screen
: Allowed easy management of remote display with real tiem monitoring
: Implemented simple database for swapping previously displayed images
: ### [Ferris Sweep Keyboard](https://github.com/bronson113/zmk-config)
: *December 2021* \| Micro-controller, Keyboard, Soldering
: I attempted to create my own keyboard using the [ferris sweep 34 key design](https://github.com/davidphilipbarr/Sweep). I used [nice-nano](https://nicekeyboards.com/nice-nano/) micro controller along with the zmk firmware to support bluetoon connection. The link above goes to the zmk config I used during the build.
